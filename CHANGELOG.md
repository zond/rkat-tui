# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

Moved out of the Meerkat monorepo (lukacf/meerkat PR 2069) into this repository as the `rkat-tui` package. The entries below are the harness's history in that PR; `docs/evidence.md` holds the detailed record and `docs/ux-parity.md` the Claude Code parity audit.

### Added

- `meerkat-tui`: a new crate whose `rkat-tui` binary is an interactive
  terminal coding harness. Its sessions run on the runtime-backed session
  path (durable Queue/Steer input while the agent works, interrupt, resume
  with `-c`/`/resume`); every tool call, helpers' included, passes an
  auto-mode approval gate (tiers, user rules, a reasoning-blind two-stage
  classifier, escalation dialogs) installed as the build's
  `ToolDispatchAdmission`; the shell runs under OS confinement by default
  (`--confinement workspace|strict|off`, `--no-confinement`); models come
  from live endpoint lists with hot swap and a per-model cost readout;
  `delegate` runs helpers as mob members, on models only an endpoint lists
  too and on the model a `/model` switch chose; instruction files (user-global
  `SYSTEM.md`/`AGENTS.md`, ancestor `AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.local.md`),
  `/remember`, notes (`note_*` tools, indexed as untrusted context), native
  semantic memory, MCP servers from `mcp.toml` (the project file's only once
  trusted with `/mcp trust` or `--allow-project-mcp`), and a native/warn/auto
  policy over native auto-compaction with `/compact now`. Configured
  endpoints and the `[models.<id>]` profiles of models only an endpoint
  knows are written into the realm's own `config.toml`, so `rkat`, REST and
  RPC resolve a TUI session's binding too; a realm `[confinement]` is a
  floor the command line may only narrow; turns end with typed outcomes
  (completed, failed, interrupted, pending, unknown); the cost readout
  states its confidence. Endpoint keys come from the environment only
  (`api_key_env`; an inline `api_key` refuses the start, and the realm
  document records only the variable's name). A host that cannot confine
  refuses the start with an explanation of what blocked it (on Linux the
  user-namespace switches, with the AppArmor profile or sysctl that fixes
  it) and how to run unconfined; `--confinement-read`/`--confinement-write`
  add directories to the sandbox; a confined command inherits none of
  `rkat-tui`'s environment but a curated set of it (`PATH`, `HOME`, locale,
  TLS roots, proxies and a few tool directories; provider API keys stay
  outside). User-global files live in `~/.rkat/tui`
  (`--config-dir` overrides; an existing `~/.config/rkat-tui` is used with a
  notice until the new directory exists). File tools never write the gate's
  own `.rkat/` state or `.git/`, nor, wherever they lie, the git directories
  governing the project (an enclosing repository's, a worktree's and its
  common dir), the realm directory or the user config directory (sealed
  paths: denied before the classifier and any allow rule, for every target
  of a patch), nor a file with another hard link, and `fork_off` is denied
  to sessions and helpers (a fork child would seat outside the approval
  gate); the session's own `fork`
  tool runs a helper that starts with the session's conversation, rendered
  as text, as context, behind the same gate. A mouse copy goes out with
  OSC 52 to the clipboard and the primary selection, written after the
  frame, and its notice says the terminal must support OSC 52. An
  escalation that arrives over an open model or resume picker parks the
  picker and restores it once no escalation remains, and a held Enter or
  Esc never answers, selects or closes a dialog. A prompt re-sent with the
  same text right after a failed turn (which already committed it) retries
  that turn instead of adding the message twice. Helpers nest at most
  `[helpers] max_depth` levels (default 1: helpers cannot delegate); a
  helper at the limit has no tool that starts helpers and a deeper spawn
  is refused. Each helper shows as one live header line (state, calls,
  last activity, tokens) that Ctrl+↑/↓ and Enter, a click or
  `/helpers expand|fold` open to show its work (`[ui] helpers` sets the
  default). An interrupt abandons the messages still queued for the
  running turn before it stops the run, so none of them runs as a
  follow-up turn after the interrupt, and every one comes back to the
  editor with the turn reported as interrupted, not failed. Esc while a
  turn runs pulls back the steers the runtime still holds queued without
  stopping the run (only when nothing is left to pull back does it
  interrupt), and the first Ctrl-C after a mouse selection only clears the
  selection. The terminal is asked for keyboard disambiguation only, not
  event types: kitty 0.32 sent a Backspace release as a second press byte,
  which deleted two characters per keystroke. A call the classifier
  allowed shows a dim `allowed by classifier: <reason>` line under its tool
  block, a denial's tag reads `[classifier checked N files, M searches]`,
  and a block for lack of user intent asks the agent to get the user's
  confirmation instead of claiming the user never asked. A file-tool write
  to a protected path in the project (`.env*`, `build.rs`, `.cargo/`,
  `AGENTS.md`, `.gitmodules`, …) always asks you in the escalation dialog,
  naming the path and why, instead of going to the classifier; an allow
  rule for the path (the dialog's "allow + rule") stops the prompts.
  Running helpers (and those finished this turn) are listed in a panel
  under the input; Ctrl+↑/↓ select one and Enter on an empty input opens
  its full view (its prose, reasoning, tool calls and nested helpers) in
  place of the transcript until Esc. Long lines in the input editor wrap
  at the field width instead of scrolling sideways; the field grows up to
  six rows and ↑/↓ move by wrapped rows. See
  `crates/meerkat-tui/README.md`. Keys follow Claude Code where both have
  the feature:
  - Ctrl+Enter sends now (interrupts a running turn and sends the input
    next, like Ctrl-X Ctrl-S) instead of inserting a newline; `\` right
    before Enter at a line end inserts a newline.
  - Ctrl+O shows or hides detail: the last reasoning block and the last
    tool output together. Ctrl+T no longer toggles tool output (it is kept
    for a task checklist); a click still toggles one tool.
  - A kill ring: Ctrl+K (kill to the line end), Ctrl+U, Ctrl+W,
    Ctrl/Alt+Backspace and Alt+D (kill the word after) push the deleted
    text; Ctrl+Y yanks it and Alt+Y cycles older kills.
  - `/copy [N]` copies the latest (or Nth latest) answer; Ctrl+Y no longer
    copies. A mouse selection still copies on release.
  - Ctrl+P/Ctrl+N work as ↑/↓ in the editor (rows first, then history).
  - Esc twice (within 1.5 s) on an idle draft clears it and saves it to
    the prompt history.
  - Ctrl+_ undoes input edits (by word, kill, yank, paste or clear; 64
    steps).
  - Ctrl+S stashes the input and, on an empty input, restores it (Ctrl+X
    Ctrl+S still sends now).
  - Ctrl+L clears the screen and redraws it.
  - Shift+Tab switches auto mode off and on (as `/auto off|on`).
  - Ctrl+D on an idle empty input asks for a second press (within 3 s)
    before quitting.
  - Esc (like Ctrl+C) always interrupts a running turn, and the messages
    queued behind it are sent as the next turn instead of returning to the
    editor; ↑ on an empty input takes queued messages back.
  - `/compact` compacts (as `/compact now`, kept as an alias, did);
    `/compact status` shows the policy; `/compact <instructions>` compacts
    with a warning that focus instructions are not supported yet.
  - `/permissions` is the rules command (`/rules` stays an alias),
    `/usage` the cost readout (`/cost` and `/stats` are aliases), and
    `/tasks` an alias of `/helpers`.
  - `rkat-tui --resume` without a reference opens the session picker.
  - `/context` prints the context gauge, the compaction policy and what the
    context holds (system prompt size, message counts, instruction files,
    rkat-tui's own tools).
  - `/status` prints the version, model and endpoint, session id,
    workspace and realm, confinement, auto mode, the trust state of
    `tui.toml` and `mcp.toml`, and the helper depth limit.
  - `/export [file]` writes the transcript as plain text (default
    `.rkat/tui/export-<session>-<time>.txt` in the workspace).
  - `/init` asks the agent, as an ordinary turn, to write or update the
    workspace `AGENTS.md` (commands, layout, conventions; under 200 lines).
  - A terminal bell rings when a turn ends or an approval prompt opens
    while the terminal is unfocused (focus reports); `[ui] bell = false`
    turns it off.
  - Alt+P opens the model picker (as `/model`) and keeps the draft.
  - Ctrl+Z suspends to the shell on Unix (`fg` resumes).
  - `/memory [user|system]` opens the workspace `AGENTS.md`, the user
    `AGENTS.md` or `SYSTEM.md` in `$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR`/`vi`; an edited
    `AGENTS.md` reaches the live session, `SYSTEM.md` the next one.
  - Ctrl+G and Ctrl+X Ctrl+E edit the input in `$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR`/`vi`.

### Changed

### Fixed

- The shell lexer no longer treats a carriage return as a blank. bash, dash
  and zsh read `\r` as a word character, so `git status \r# ; rm -rf x` was
  judged as the allowlisted `git status` while the shell ran `rm`. Any control
  character other than tab and newline (`\r`, a `\r\n` line ending, NUL,
  ESC, `\v`, `\f`, DEL, C1) now makes the command unsupported, so the gate
  escalates it.
